**Unfortunately, Reversed-Tetris only support Chrome browser.**

Reversed-Tetris is a web-based game written in pure JavaScript without any dependency. Be compare with most web-based games, Reversed-Tetris use Dom as the render engine, instead of the canvas. It's less performant, but more like a "web platform" prodact.
